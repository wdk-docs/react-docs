title: "与团队会面"

<Intro>

React开发由Meta的专职团队领导。它还接受世界各地人民的捐款。

</Intro>

## React Core {/*react-core*/}

React Core团队成员全职工作于核心组件APIs、为React DOM和React Native提供动力的引擎、React DevTools和React文档网站。

React团队的现有成员按字母顺序排列如下。

<TeamMember name="Andrew Clark" permalink="andrew-clark" photo="/images/team/acdlite.jpg" github="acdlite" twitter="acdlite" threads="acdlite" title="Engineer at Vercel">
    Andrew开始使用WordPress进行网站开发，并最终诱骗自己使用JavaScript。他最喜欢的消遣是卡拉OK。安德鲁要么是迪士尼的反派，要么是迪士尼公主，这取决于哪一天。

<TeamMember name="Andrey Lunyov" permalink="andrey-lunyov" photo="/images/team/andrey-lunyov.jpg" github="alunyov" twitter="alunyov" threads="alunyov" title="Engineer at Meta">
    Andrey的职业生涯始于设计师，后来逐渐过渡到网络开发领域。在加入Meta的React Data团队后，他致力于向Relay添加一个增量JavaScript编译器，后来又致力于从Relay中删除相同的编译器。工作之余，安德烈喜欢演奏音乐和参加各种运动。

<TeamMember name="Dan Abramov" permalink="dan-abramov" photo="/images/team/gaearon.jpg" github="gaearon" twitter="dan_abramov2" title="Independent Engineer">
    丹偶然发现了微软PowerPoint中的Visual Basic后，开始从事编程工作。他把Sebastian（#Sebastian markbåge）的推文变成了长篇博客，这才是他真正的使命。丹偶尔会躲在灌木丛中直到比赛结束，从而在Fortnite获胜。

<TeamMember name="Eli White" permalink="eli-white" photo="/images/team/eli-white.jpg" github="TheSavior" twitter="Eli_White" threads="elicwhite" title="Engineering Manager at Meta">
    伊莱因黑客行为被中学停课后开始从事编程工作。自2017年以来，他一直致力于React和React Native。他喜欢吃零食，尤其是冰淇淋和苹果派。你可以看到Eli尝试一些古怪的活动，比如跑酷、室内跳伞和空中丝绸。

<TeamMember name="Jason Bonta" permalink="jason-bonta" photo="/images/team/jasonbonta.jpg" threads="someextent" title="Engineering Manager at Meta">
    Jason喜欢把大量的亚马逊包裹送到办公室，这样他就可以建造堡垒。尽管有时他会把自己与团队隔离开来，也不知道循环是如何工作的，但我们感谢他为自己的工作带来的独特品质。
</TeamMember>

<TeamMember name="Joe Savona" permalink="joe-savona" photo="/images/team/joe.jpg" github="josephsavona" twitter="en_JS" threads="joesavona" title="Engineer at Meta">
    乔原本计划主修数学和哲学，但在用Matlab编写物理模拟后进入了计算机科学。在加入React之前，他曾研究Relay、RSocket.js和Skip编程语言。虽然他没有建立某种被动的系统，但他喜欢跑步、学习日语和与家人共度时光。
</TeamMember>

<TeamMember name="Josh Story" permalink="josh-story" photo="/images/team/josh.jpg" github="gnoff" twitter="joshcstory" title="Engineer at Vercel">
    Josh主修数学，在大学期间发现了编程。他的第一份专业开发工作是在Microsoft Excel中编写保险费率计算程序，这是Reactive编程的典范，这也是他现在从事React工作的原因。在此期间，Josh曾在一些初创公司担任IC、经理和高管。工作之外，他喜欢在烹饪方面突破极限。

<TeamMember name="Lauren Tan" permalink="lauren-tan" photo="/images/team/lauren.jpg" github="poteto" twitter="potetotes" threads="potetotes" personal="no.lol" title="Engineer at Meta">
    当Lauren第一次发现`<marquee>`标签时，她的编程生涯达到了顶峰。从那以后，她一直在追求那个高度。当她不在React中添加bug时，她喜欢在聊天中删除厚脸皮的表情包，并与她的伴侣和她的狗塞尔达玩太多的电子游戏。
</TeamMember>

<TeamMember name="Luna Wei" permalink="luna-wei" photo="/images/team/luna-wei.jpg" github="lunaleaps" twitter="lunaleaps" threads="lunaleaps" title="Engineer at Meta">
    Luna first learnt the fundamentals of python at the age of 6 from her father. Since then, she has been unstoppable. Luna aspires to be a gen z, and the road to success is paved with environmental advocacy, urban gardening and lots of quality time with her Voo-Doo’d (as pictured).

<TeamMember name="Matt Carroll" permalink="matt-carroll" photo="/images/team/matt-carroll.png" github="mattcarrollcode" twitter="mattcarrollcode" threads="mattcarrollcode" title="Developer Advocate at Meta">
    Matt stumbled into coding, and since then, has become enamored with creating things in communities that can’t be created alone. Prior to React, he worked on YouTube, the Google Assistant, Fuchsia, and Google Cloud AI and Evernote. When he's not trying to make better developer tools he enjoys the mountains, jazz, and spending time with his family.

<TeamMember name="Mofei Zhang" permalink="mofei-zhang" photo="/images/team/mofei-zhang.png" github="mofeiZ" threads="z_mofei" title="Engineer at Meta">
    Mofei started programming when she realized it can help her cheat in video games. She focused on operating systems in undergrad / grad school, but now finds herself happily tinkering on React. Outside of work, she enjoys debugging bouldering problems and planning her next backpacking trip(s).
</TeamMember>

<TeamMember name="Noah Lemen" permalink="noah-lemen" photo="/images/team/noahlemen.jpg" github="noahlemen" twitter="noahlemen" threads="noahlemen" personal="noahle.men" title="Engineer at Meta">
    Noah’s interest in UI programming sparked during his education in music technology at NYU. At Meta, he's worked on internal tools, browsers, web performance, and is currently focused on React. Outside of work, Noah can be found tinkering with synthesizers or spending time with his cat.

<TeamMember name="Rick Hanlon" permalink="rick-hanlon" photo="/images/team/rickhanlonii.jpg" github="rickhanlonii" twitter="rickhanlonii" threads="rickhanlonii" personal="rickhanlon.codes" title="Engineer at Meta">
    Ricky majored in theoretical math and somehow found himself on the React Native team for a couple years before joining the React team. When he's not programming you can find him snowboarding, biking, climbing, golfing, or closing GitHub issues that do not match the issue template.
</TeamMember>

<TeamMember name="Sathya Gunasekaran " permalink="sathya-gunasekaran" photo="/images/team/sathya.jpg" github="gsathya" twitter="_gsathya" threads="gsathya.03" title="Engineer at Meta">
    Sathya hated the Dragon Book in school but somehow ended up working on compilers all his career. When he's not compiling React components, he's either drinking coffee or eating yet another Dosa.
</TeamMember>

<TeamMember name="Sebastian Markbåge" permalink="sebastian-markbåge" photo="/images/team/sebmarkbage.jpg" github="sebmarkbage" twitter="sebmarkbage" threads="sebmarkbage" title="Engineer at Vercel">
    Sebastian majored in psychology. He's usually quiet. Even when he says something, it often doesn't make sense to the rest of us until a few months later. The correct way to pronounce his surname is "mark-boa-geh" but he settled for "mark-beige" out of pragmatism -- and that's how he approaches React.
</TeamMember>

<TeamMember name="Sebastian Silbermann" permalink="sebastian-silbermann" photo="/images/team/sebsilbermann.jpg" github="eps1lon" twitter="sebsilbermann" threads="sebsilbermann" title="Independent Engineer">
    Sebastian learned programming to make the browser games he played during class more enjoyable. Eventually this lead to contributing to as much open source code as possible. Outside of coding he's busy making sure people don't confuse him with the other Sebastians and Zilberman of the React community.
</TeamMember>

<TeamMember name="Seth Webster" permalink="seth-webster" photo="/images/team/seth.jpg" github="sethwebster" twitter="sethwebster" threads="sethwebster" personal="sethwebster.com" title="Engineering Manager at Meta">
    Seth started programming as a kid growing up in Tucson, AZ. After school, he was bitten by the music bug and was a touring musician for about 10 years before returning to *work*, starting with Intuit. In his spare time, he loves [taking pictures](https://www.sethwebster.com) and flying for animal rescues in the northeastern United States.

<TeamMember name="Sophie Alpert" permalink="sophie-alpert" photo="/images/team/sophiebits.jpg" github="sophiebits" twitter="sophiebits" threads="sophiebits" personal="sophiebits.com" title="Independent Engineer">
    Four days after React was released, Sophie rewrote the entirety of her then-current project to use it, which she now realizes was perhaps a bit reckless. After she became the project's #1 committer, she wondered why she wasn't getting paid by Facebook like everyone else was and joined the team officially to lead React through its adolescent years. Though she quit that job years ago, somehow she's still in the team's group chats and “providing value”.

<TeamMember name="Tianyu Yao" permalink="tianyu-yao" photo="/images/team/tianyu.jpg" github="tyao1" twitter="tianyu0" title="Engineer at Meta">
    Tianyu’s interest in computers started as a kid because he loves video games. So he majored in computer science and still plays childish games like League of Legends. When he is not in front of a computer, he enjoys playing with his two kittens, hiking and kayaking.
</TeamMember>

<TeamMember name="Yuzhi Zheng" permalink="yuzhi-zheng" photo="/images/team/yuzhi.jpg" github="yuzhi" twitter="yuzhiz" threads="yuzhiz" title="Engineering Manager at Meta">
    Yuzhi studied Computer Science in school. She liked the instant gratification of seeing code come to life without having to physically be in a laboratory. Now she’s a manager in the React org. Before management, she used to work on the Relay data fetching framework. In her spare time, Yuzhi enjoys optimizing her life via gardening and home improvement projects.
